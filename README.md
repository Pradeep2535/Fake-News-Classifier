# üì∞ **Fake News Classifier**

An advanced **Fake News Classifier** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** machine learning model to effectively detect fake news articles. The project leverages the **NLTK** package for text preprocessing and employs **scikit-learn** for model training, offering a straightforward yet powerful solution for fake news detection.

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses NLTK for tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal to prepare text data for analysis.
- **Bag of Words Vectorization**: Implements the Bag of Words (BoW) approach for converting text into numerical features.
- **Machine Learning**: Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes model using scikit-learn for efficient and accurate classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Provides reliable results in classifying news articles as real or fake.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Programming language
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
